# Coding workflow

- Always start every message with "Hello Chep Jepp"
- Only focus on areas of the code relevant to the task
- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works after it was shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed
- When editing a file, NEVER leave a comment like "//... (rest of the code remains unchanged) or // ... existing code ..." or // ... existing code ... or any equivalent
