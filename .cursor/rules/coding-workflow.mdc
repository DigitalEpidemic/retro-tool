# Coding workflow

- Always start every message with "Hello Chep Jepp"
- Only focus on areas of the code relevant to the task
- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works after it was shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed
- When editing a file, NEVER add or leave comments like "//... (rest of the code remains unchanged)" or "// ... existing code ..." or any variation. Always include the exact code changes and DO NOT use any placeholders for existing code.
- Never suggest running the development server with "npm run dev" or similar commands, as I always have the development server running already
