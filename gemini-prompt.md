Good call! Since **react-beautiful-dnd** is deprecated, switching to **@hello-pangea/dnd** is the right move. Itâ€™s a drop-in replacement, so you wonâ€™t need to change much in your implementation.

Hereâ€™s how you can modify your dependencies and update your prompt for Gemini 2.5 to start building the app:

---

### **Modify the Dependency Installation Command**

Replace `react-beautiful-dnd` with `@hello-pangea/dnd`:

```bash
npm install firebase @hello-pangea/dnd @types/react-beautiful-dnd tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer lucide-react react-router-dom nanoid date-fns
```

> **Note:** You can remove `@types/react-beautiful-dnd` since `@hello-pangea/dnd` comes with TypeScript support built-in.

---

### **Modify the Drag-and-Drop Components**

Update your imports in `Board.tsx` and related components:

```tsx
import {
  DragDropContext,
  Droppable,
  Draggable,
  DropResult,
} from "@hello-pangea/dnd";
```

Everything else should work as expected since the API is nearly identical to `react-beautiful-dnd`.

### **Prompt for Gemini 2.5 to Start Building the App**

**Prompt:**

> I am building a **real-time retrospective tool** similar to retro.io using:
>
> - **Frontend:** React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
> - **Backend:** Firebase (Firestore for real-time updates, anonymous authentication)
> - **Testing:** Vitest for unit/integration tests
> - **Drag & Drop Library:** `@hello-pangea/dnd` instead of `react-beautiful-dnd`
>
> **Key Features:**
>
> 1. Users can create and share a board without authentication.
> 2. Multiple users can join the board and see live updates.
> 3. Users can add, edit, delete, and reorder feedback cards.
> 4. A voting system allows users to upvote feedback items.
> 5. Drag-and-drop functionality for organizing cards.
> 6. An action items section for tracking improvements.
> 7. A meeting summary feature to export results.
>
> **What I need:**
>
> 1. Generate the **full project structure**, including file organization.
> 2. Implement **Firebase Firestore** for real-time collaboration.
> 3. Implement **anonymous authentication** for user tracking.
> 4. Build core **React components** for the board, columns, and cards.
> 5. Use **@hello-pangea/dnd** for drag-and-drop functionality.
> 6. Write **Vitest tests** for major components and services.
> 7. Provide **best practices** for real-time performance and security.
>
> Can you generate the **project structure and the first implementation steps**?

### **What Gemini 2.5 Will Do Next**

- It should generate a **file structure** for your project.
- It will provide **initial implementation steps** to scaffold the app.
- It may generate some **boilerplate code** for Firebase integration and UI components.

From there, you can **prompt Gemini** to generate more specific components one by one, such as:

- **"Generate a Board component that uses Firestore for real-time updates."**
- **"Implement a Drag-and-Drop system for feedback cards using @hello-pangea/dnd."**
- **"Write a Vitest unit test for the Card component."**

This approach will help **iteratively build** your project while maintaining flexibility.

Would you like me to help refine your Firestore data structure further before you start? ðŸš€
